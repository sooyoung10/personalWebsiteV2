        “remember the kim family motto: to be able to survive anywhere no matter what,” my dad reminded me many times.
    </p>

    <p>
        since i was a little boy, i’ve been “training” all my life to survive anywhere no matter what.<br/>
        the sahara? no problem: my family never turned on the air conditioner in case we move to a scorching desert.<br/>
        the himalayas? all prepared: going on 9 mile hikes has been a staple of the kim family vacations.<br/>
        a tsunami? no sweat: ever since running a 5 km marathon as a 4 year old, i’ve trained enough to outrun it...<br/>
        or, at least, this is what my parents claimed whenever i complained about our “training.” 
    </p>

    <p>
        back then, i didn’t understand why we had to train for such extreme situations because those were not in our foreseeable future.
    </p>

    <p>
        but looking back now, the seemingly pointless training prepared me with the mental and physical strength to overcome any adversities i may face.

    <p>
        now i know i can survive anywhere no matter what.
